# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024
As always this repo is for me to mess around in rather than anyone else to peer at, but if you're here for some reason (or if you're future me), hi!

I'm intending to try out some of the features of Deno this year.
Reminder to myself:

To run a file call `$ deno nameoffile.js`
